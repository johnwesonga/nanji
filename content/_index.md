Nanjala is a dedicated pianist studying under
powerhouse concert pianist Olga Kern at the
Manhattan School of Music. She has been honored
by the Gustav Mahler Piano Prize and is a
successive winner of the Young Musicians
Competition. Having achieved distinction in ABRSM
Grades 1-8 in her foundational years, Nanjala
continues to refine her artistry through both
performance and study.

Through her concept of ‘sonic séance,’ Nanjala strives to create a space where both
performer and audience actively channel the emotional energy of the music. In doing
so, she honors the Divine Feminine force that has guided her, embracing the nurturing,
intuitive qualities that infuse her artistry. Her performances become a shared
experience, one where the audience&#39;s emotional landscapes are as integral to the
performance as the music itself.
